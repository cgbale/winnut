-> Under some versions of Windows with certain hardware, windows will 
   shutdown to the "It is now safe to turn off your compute" screen instead
   of powering down the machine.
-> Under Windows 2000 (and possibly NT - don't have a machine to test on)
   if the UPS goes critical, and the shutdown mode is "Normal", if the NT
   shutdown is canceled by the user (like at the save dialog (yes, no, 
   cancel) - pressing cancel cancels the machine shutdown), WinNUT will be
   unable to perform another shutdown until the computer is rebooted.  
   This appears to be a microsoft bug, as calling the shutdown function
   returns an error ERROR_SHUTDOWN_IN_PROGRESS after a shutdown started in
   this manner is canceled
