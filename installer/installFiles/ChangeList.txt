2.0.0.4
->Added Windows 7 and UAC support.
->Fixed inconsistency in handling of the NOTIFYCMD variable. Provides more flexibility but all paths
  with spaces must now be enclosed in additional quotes. Sample config updated to reflect this change.
->Removed extra notification on shutdown that would be shown no matter what NOTIFYFLAG preferences were
  set to.
->Cleanup of minor errors and formatting of notification text.

========================================================================================================
2.0.0.3
->Added Hibernate Option, switched to Visual Studio 2008 project.

========================================================================================================
2.0.0b
->Added recognition of Windows 2003 Server and Windows Vista

=========================================================================================================
2.0.0a
->Ported the current version of the NUT upsmon code over.  This added the following key features:
	+Support for the new network protocol

=========================================================================================================
1.2.1a
->Ported the current version of the NUT upsmon code over.  This added the following key features:
	+Support for login name
	+New config file parser
	+New implementation of the network communication protocol
	+Some timing improvements 
->Setup a proper windows installer for WinNUT
->Updated documentation to reference installations via installer

=========================================================================================================
0.45.2c
->Really fixed bug where IP addresses where not properly being resolved in ups system declarations due
   to an incompatiblity of the windows networking API.  (Previous fix only worked if IP could be resolved
   thru a reverse DNS lookup)
0.45.2b
-> Fixed bug where IP addresses where not properly being resolved in ups system declarations due
   to an incompatiblity of the windows networking API.
-> Ported over an important new feature in the NUT upsmon.  Upon UPS mon seeing that the battery
   is critical, it waits up to HOSTSYNC (as defined in the upsmon.conf) for the master upsmon to
   send out a FSD (Force Shut Down) command, which prevents the race condition where power is 
   restored soon after the UPS goes critical and the master doesn't shutdown.  If it doesn't see 
   the FSD after HOSTSYNC seconds it assumes the master is dead and shutdown anyway.
-> Added new feature that allows you to specify that WinNUT should shutdown the windows machine
   after x seconds of being on battery power.  If the ups battery becomes critical/recieves FSD 
   before this timer expires, WinNUT goes ahead and shuts down the system immediately.
-> Added some simple validation to WinNUTConfiguration tool for port, shutdown seconds, and the
   WinNUT Executable path.

=========================================================================================================
0.45.2a
-> Ported the current upsmon code base to WinNUT.  This took care of lots of config file loading 
   issues, especially relating to extra spaces in the config file.
-> Fixed issue with NT 4 not working in service mode.  (caused 
   Error 2186: The service is not responding to the control function) which was caused because
   I was using win2k API extentions
-> Fixed problem where if not enough power was configured in the config file, WinNUT would initiate
   a shutdown.  Now WinNutUPSMon will show an error message box and exit.
-> WinNUT now shows a proper error message if the ups configured in the conf file doesn't exist.

=========================================================================================================
0.44.1c
-> added ability to change shutdown types (Forced, Normal) in config tool and monitor daemon
-> Added daemon stop and start functionality to the config tool
-> Added current daemon status to the config tool
-> Registering daemon as win9x "service" process so it doesn't get killed when user logs out 
   (need this now because we register as a windows application, and would now be shutdown otherwise)
-> Config tool now use the Service manager API to register as a NT service, so reboots are no longer 
   required after installation to use the service.
-> Daemon is now registered with the event log service under NT/2000 so the event log messages show
   properly.
-> Created winupscommon.c/h to contain all code / constants common to the config tool and the 
   daemon.  This includes registry load and store functions / constants, configuration struct,
   as well as daemon start / stop / and current status functions.
-> Completely restructured the daemon code.
   Almost all code for handling windows events, services, etc is now in WinNUTMain.c.  Removed the
   Microsoft sample code that probably can't be release under GPL with my own completely new
   implementation - which should conform better to the services API.
   The application mode daemon now registers as a windows application so it has a proper message 
   loop (before this was only created when we had to display the win9x shutdown).  This allows 
   the daemon to handle windows 9x shutdown so it doesn't leave open connections on the upsd side.
   The restructuring along with some of the other changes should make it easier to port over newer
   versions of the nut code.
-> The previous syslog function was a hack, and only handled event code and 2 string parameters.
   It has been replaced with a new system that uses "..." arguement so it works like printf.  Also
   added Mutex based locking to prevent race conditions during setup, writing, and closing of the
   log file.
-> I finally found that function I'd been looking for in the Win32API, so now AlertPopup uses the
   MessageBox function to popup the message.  This is better than the old popup, as it can popup
   on the NT login screen, it wraps text, looks nicer, it's less coding for me...
-> Added -c stop command to stop any running WinNUTUpsMon daemons
-> Added -c start command to start the winnut daemon (service or application mode)
-> Added Application mutex that prevents multiple copies of the daemon to monitor simultanously

=========================================================================================================
0.44.1b
(created from bugs fixed list)
-> Added notification for loss of connection with upsd
-> Documented the configurable shutdown delay
-> Fixed Network error codes not being properly displayed
-> Errors from initial connections were not documented
-> Incorrect shutdown parameters caused ME to suspend instead of shutdown
-> Improved documentation in the shipping upsmon.conf
-> Fixed initialization bug in config tool that caused first installations to get garbage for 
   initial config parameters
-> Fixed problem where NT Service mode wasn't prperly closing connections to upsd on system shutdown
-> Fixed problem where NT Service would disconnect from upsd before the system shutdown actually 
   started which could lead to the power being cut before shutdown finishes
-> Added uninstall documentation to readme
-> Changed logging channels for errors to be more reasonable
-> Cleaned up spacing of log files and added string descriptions to for the log channels

=========================================================================================================
0.44.1a
