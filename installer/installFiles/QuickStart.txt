1) You must have a nut ups daemon running on a another system (windows version 
   is currently the monitor client only) that is monitoring the desired ups.  
   (available at http://random.networkupstools.org)

2) Run the WinNutConfigurationTool.exe
   NOTE: NT/2000 users: you need to be logged in as an administrative
   user to be able to install.
   A) WinNut Executable Path should be the full path to WinNutUpsMon.exe
   B) Configuration file path should be the full path to the upsmon.conf you 
        would like to use (we will edit this in the next step)
   C) Log File path should be the full path to where you want the log file 
        created
   D) Select which log channels you wish to log (really everything but debug 
        is pretty reasonable).
   E) Select the appropriate options for the automatic startup if you so desire
   F) UPSD PORT: All versions of nut since Version 0.50.0 use 3493 by default, 
        earlier versions used 3305.  Your server may have been setup with a 
        different port.  You can override this value in the upsmon.conf file 
        per server being monitored.  This can also be specified per ups in 
        the MONITOR tag of the upsmon.conf
   G) Choose your shutdown type - I recommend FORCED - see Readme.txt for more 
      info on this.
   H) If you so desire, you can have the windows machine shutdown after x 
      seconds on battery power (before battery is critical) if you want to give
      other machines on the ups a longer runtime.  For more info see the 
      Readme.txt.

3) Edit the upsmon.conf to
   A) Setup the ups the machine is monitoring (see the MONITOR section)
   B) By default the notify command is set to 
        "c:\\Program Files\\WinNUT\\alertPopup.exe"
        Fill in the path to the notify command in the NOTIFYCMD section if this
        is not where you installed WinNUT
      NOTE: This should work with any program that will take a message as a 
        double quoted command line arg.  The alertPopup.exe is provide for this 
        purpose as noted in the example.
      NOTE: You must escape backslashes in paths in the configuration file
        ie: c:\bin\WinNUT needs to be in the config file as c:\\bin\\WinNUT
      NOTE: surround file names double quotes if they contain spaces

4) Start up the daemon
   For all versions of windows, you can use the WinNutConfigurationTool to 
     start and stop the daemon
   OR
   You can also use the program icons installed under Start->Programs->WinNUT

   Also
   Under Win9X and NT/2000 (not configured to run as service or autostart):
   -> simply double click the WinNutUpsMon.exe

   Under NT/2000 (configured to run as a service):
   If it is in automatic start mode, it will automatically start after your 
     next reboot. To start it now, follow the manual start instructions.
   If you opted to start it manually, do the following
   Select Start->Run
     Type (without quotes) "net start WinNutUpsMon" and press enter
   or use the GUI services manager from the control panel.
   or use the installed icons in the Start menu
