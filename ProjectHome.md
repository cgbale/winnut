Thanks to Bill we now have a new installer package that adds support for Microsoft Windows 7.  See the Downloads area for more details and the new package.

This is an attempt to revive the WinNut project http://csociety.ecn.purdue.edu/~delpha/winnut/ that hasn't been updated since 2006.

I want to be able to add the option to hibernate a windows client when the UPS goes critical. This seems like a much better option than forcing a log off and shut down possibly causing data loss because of applications that were still running on the system.

I created this project in order to be able to share this modification with others that may find it useful and in the hope that this project will encourage others to help with adding features or updating the code to keep up with the nut project.

Please contact me if you are interested in contributing to the project!
